    <h1 class="history">History of Dota</h1>
    <P class="description"><strong>Dota" stands for Defense of the Ancients, and its history can be traced back to the late 1990s. The original Dota mod was created for the game Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, which was released by Blizzard Entertainment in 2002. The mod was developed by a designer known as Eul, who introduced the basic concept of a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game where players control individual hero units with unique abilities.</strong></P>

        <p>The success and popularity of Dota as a Warcraft III custom map led to the creation of various versions, with <a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients:_Allstars" target="_blank">"DotA Allstars"</a> being one of the most prominent. DotA Allstars continued to attract a large player base within the Warcraft III gaming community.

          In 2009, Valve Corporation, a game development company, collaborated with IceFrog to create a standalone sequel to Dota, named Dota 2. Dota 2 was officially released in 2013 and became a major player in the multiplayer online battle arena genre. It retained the core gameplay elements from the original Dota while introducing updated graphics, new heroes, and additional features.
          
          Since it's release, Dota 2 has become one of the most popular and enduring games in the esports scene, with a dedicated player base and a thriving competitive scene, including the annual tournament called "The International."</p>
